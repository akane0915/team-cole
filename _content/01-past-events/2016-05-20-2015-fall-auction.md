<p class="MsoNormal">Team Cole held its annual fundraising auction on November 14<sup>th</sup>,
2015 at digital digs of Sq1 in Portland, Oregon. The purpose of the event was
to support the family of Nathalie Traller who, until recently, had been
fighting ASAP (Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma). The $47,000 in proceeds went to
help the Traller family pay for the many medical bills they had accrued over
Nathalie’s struggle, and also helped 11 other families selected throughout the
year. The walls were close to bursting with people socializing and supporting
Nathalie’s fight. Al-Amir restaurant provided food and drinks, keeping the
evening flavorful and fun, while the auction kept people on top of their game
with vacations, Nike apparel, signed artwork, sports memorabilia and so much
more. The Team Cole auction was a huge success, raising over $47,000 for the
Traller’s and other families in need. Thanks to everyone who put the needs of
others on their radar for the evening.   <o:p></o:p></p>
