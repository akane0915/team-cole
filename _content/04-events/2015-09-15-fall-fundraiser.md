<h3>Join Us for the 4th Annual Team Cole Fundraiser, Benefitting Nathalie Trallerâ€™s Family</h3>
<p>Nathalie Traller set the example on what it means to run the race. In her battle with ASPS (Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma), a rare pediatric sarcoma without known chemotherapy, she was always a shining beacon of perseverance. This event is centered on celebrating her race and the race of others going through similar struggles. 100% of the proceeds will go to the Traller family and other families with kids fighting cancer.</p>
