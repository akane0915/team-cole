    photo_title: Derek Hahm
    bio: Derek is Chief of Staff at Craft Brew Alliance, which means he’s one of the guys you thank whenever you sip one of your favorite beers, like Red Hook, Widmer Hefe, and Kona. Even though CBA is now the fifth largest brewery in the nation, Derek works hard to maintain close ties to the local community, giving back whenever he can. It is this commitment to others that makes him such a valued board member of Team Cole.

    bio: When Cole was diagnosed with Stage 4 Leukemia, Brian was amazed at how the community rallied behind his family, helping out however and whenever they could. He knows firsthand the harsh reality of caring for a child with cancer. So as board member of Team Cole, he wants other parents to know they don’t have to face it alone. His day job, however, is Business Director at Larger Thank Life. You can see their latest high quality graphics and prints throughout the city of Portland, including many Trimet buses and trains.
