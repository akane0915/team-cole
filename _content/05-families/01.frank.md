<p>Sadie is a brave little girl fighting a mitochondrial disease. This page is a place of encouragement, prayers, and updates.</p><p>To all Sadie's prayer warriors- please read this update from Sadie's mom about Sadie's diagnosis: Sadie has been diagnosed with a rare genetic form of Mitochondrial Disease. This disease is caused by defects in every cell of the body which are responsible for the body's energy production. It is incurable. Children with Mitochondrial Disease do not live long. Until then she will continue to deteriorate. While she is still here, I will be her voice. I will be her comfort. I will be her protector. I will do everything in my power to make sure her life is a life of quality, hope and most of all love. Please continue to pray for Sadie.</p>
