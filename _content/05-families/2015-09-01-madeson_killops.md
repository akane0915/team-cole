<p>Madeson Killops just turned two on June 7th of this year. Later that month, on Father’s Day, she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. She is now receiving treatment at Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, OR. Her parents, Kato and Ryan, along with Madeson’s loving grandparents, have been staying at the hospital and helping to keep Madeson's spirits up.

<p>Madeson is such a brave and resilient little lady--she is doing remarkably well with her chemotherapy treatment so far! She is currently undergoing her fourth round of intensive chemotherapy, which is projected to be her last since her bone marrow results have been consistently negative.
</p>
<p>Madeson seems to bring a ray of sunshine into any room she enters with her exuberance and love of life--even in the hospital! She is intensely imaginative and seems to find fun in any situation. Madeson loves her family and her animals (two cats and a dog), playing outside, and picking fresh tomatoes and peas from the garden.
