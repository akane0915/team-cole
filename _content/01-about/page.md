<p>Cole Hexum beat cancer. He wants to help other kids do the same. That's the mission of Team Cole: to win the day against cancer in those suffering from it.<br></p><p>During his ordeal, Cole realized one of the best ways to inspire hope in others is to unite the community behind them. Team Cole does this by organizing fundraisers for families in need. We also organize visits from local celebrities, as we know the awareness their presence can bring.</p><p>In the darkest times, help can seem miles away. But at Team Cole, it's always within reach.</p>
