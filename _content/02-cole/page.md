<p>That's the maxim of the University of Oregon Ducks and young Cole Hexum, who at the age of seven, was diagnosed with Stage 4 Burkitt's Leukemia – one of the fastest spreading, most aggressive cancers.<br></p><p>That's the reality Cole and his family faced in September of 2012. Yet, as he began his chemotherapy, Cole resumed living the life of an active, ordinary boy. He played sports. He continued to swim. He wrestled with his brothers – all while battling the attacker within him. On February 4th, Cole was released from the hospital. He had beat cancer; he had won the day.</p><p>During his battle, Cole drew strength from his friends, family, and the community rallying behind him, cheering him on every step of the way. Having now defeated cancer, he set a new goal – to help other cancer victims by giving them the same unwavering support he had gotten.</p><p>Cole was there. He knows anyone can win.</p>
