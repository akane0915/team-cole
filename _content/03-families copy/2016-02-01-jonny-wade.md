<p>The day after Christmas, Jonny Wade, a 7 year old twin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor and later that evening, had brain surgery.  He had his first headache only 7 days prior.  Soon after, it was confirmed that Jonny has a rare brain cancer called Medullobalstoma and it has spread to his spine.  In less than 3 weeks, Jonny underwent 5 surgeries, which 4 were in his brain.  A shunt was placed due to a condition called Hydrocephalus, where fluid accumulates in the brain. Jonny had a yearlong treatment plan which includes Proton Radiation Therapy (brain and spine) followed by Chemotherapy, which both have horrific side effects. Jonny passed away Christmas Eve of 2015. His mother, Kimberly, had this to say:</p>
 
<p>“In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to the City of Jerseyville Parks & Recreation Department, which will benefit children of the area for many years to come, and reflect the selfless and giving nature that was Jonny Wade.
Please make checks payable to Crawford Funeral Home and can be mailed to the funeral home at 1308 State Highway 109, Jerseyville, Illinois 62052.</p>
<p>You know, Jonny loved baseball. So, we have decided to donate any funds made out to Crawford Funeral Home in memory of Jonny to the Parks and Recreation Department. I would love to upgrade a few things on the ball fields and place a nice (big.... Hee hee) statue, I mean plaque, of Jonny there for all to see. Jacky will be playing on those fields for many years to come and I know this would make him, along with us, extremely proud.”</p>
