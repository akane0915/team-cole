<p style="margin: 0px;">In
January 2016, Otto had just turned five years old, and he began complaining of
pain in his legs. Throughout the first weeks of January, the pain worsened over
time, and he underwent numerous tests in order to determine a cause. When he
began vomiting in addition to his pain, with no obvious cause, he was admitted
to Doernbecher Children's Hospital, where a bone marrow biopsy revealed that he
had Stage IV Neuroblastoma, a form of pediatric cancer. His prognosis was
uncertain, and his treatment would be intense.</p>



<p style="margin: 0px;">Otto
underwent emergency brain surgery to remove a golfball sized tumor from the
right side of his brain, and began chemotherapy to treat the cancer that had
spread throughout his bone marrow and bones shortly thereafter. Throughout it
all, he has remained inquisitive and sunny, a sweet little boy who has charmed
all of his nurses and doctors. </p>



<p style="margin: 0px;">Since
last January, Otto has undergone eight rounds of chemotherapy, an additional
surgery to remove a tumor within his right adrenal gland, and two rounds of
MIBG therapy (a form of intravenous radiation) in tandem with two more rounds
of chemotherapy. </p>



<p style="margin: 0px;">Despite
all of this grueling treatment, Otto's cancer remains stubborn in its invasion
of his bones, spine, and an additonal tumor in his skull base. It is
retreating, finally, slowly, but he still has a long road of treatment ahead of
him. </p>



His family has struggled with the loss of his mother's
income as she cares for him, and any donations would be a great relief to them
as they travel this road with Otto. He is still fighting, and we will fight
until we win.
