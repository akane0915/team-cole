<p style="margin: 0px;">On October 1st, 2016 Edenn was diagnosed with 3 tumors in
her abdomen. After sliding down the stairs on her stomach while at a friend's
house,  one tumor ruptured causing her a lot of pain.  Edenn had to
take a life flight up to Doernbecher's Children's Hospital for an emergency
surgery. The surgeon ended up taking 2/3 of her stomach, 2 1/2 feet of
intestine and some of her liver, as it had spread. A few days later we learned
that she has something called GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal tumors). The
pediatric type of this cancer is very rare. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">Since surgery, Edenn has been healing great and has inspired
all of us with her strength. She's working on getting her strength back so that
she can start doing the things she loves again. </p>
