Five year old Kora, the youngest daughter of Michelle & Kyle Chard, has been diagnosed with an optic nerve glioma called Astrocytoma.  Astrocytomas are a complication of Neurofibromatosis Type 1, which Kora and her sisters have. Luckily, the tumor was caught early, but treatment will be lengthy and expensive for the family.  The Chards are lucky to have health insurance, but much of the treatment will go beyond health insurance coverage and require that Michelle and Kyle miss work to attend treatments.  Kora is a sweet, funny, beautiful, and smart girl. Any help you can give her family during this difficult time would be greatly appreciated.
