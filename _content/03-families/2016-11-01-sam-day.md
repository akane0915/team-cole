<p style="margin: 0px;">In September of
2010, Sam was diagnosed with a type of bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma. With
one tumor in his left bula, Sam had an 80% chance at survival following a 9
month intensive chemotherapy regimen. At least 1/3 of his third grade year was spent
in the hospital. He endured hair loss, nausea, weight loss, bone pain,
amputation, mouth sores, the loss of friendships and social experiences, and a
compromised immune system. One year after chemotherapy ended, Sam relapsed with
a tumor in his right foot. After more chemotherapy and the removal of part of
his foot, he then relapsed with small tumors in his lungs.  Sam lost his
fight on August 27, 2016.</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><br></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">Sam happened to be fighting cancer at a time when remarkable
discoveries are being made in research labs across the country. Clinical trials
now offer novel, less toxic treatments in the forms of immunotherapy and
targeted drugs. Ewing’s sarcoma is a cancer that has a great deal of promise
for success with these new treatments. With proper funding, support and
advocacy, there is truly hope for a cure.</p>
