<p class="MsoNormal">In December
of 2012 Shelby Tisdale noticed some odd bruising on her son Cohen’s neck and
chest.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A
pediatrician’s blood test revealed worrying figures: Cohen’s platelet count was
extremely low. He was immediately referred to a hematologist and oncologist.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After
more extensive tests and invasive biopsy, the specialists’ worst fears were
confirmed. Cohen had a rare disease called aplastic anemia.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In
layman’s terms, Cohen’s bone marrow had lost the ability to produce all three
types of blood cells to maturity, causing a dangerous deficiency.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Without
red blood cells, his blood can’t transport oxygen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Without
platelets, his blood can’t clot if he bleeds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Without
white blood cells, he can’t fight infections.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And
without a biological sibling, he has no easy match for a Blood and Marrow
Transplant (BMT). His only course of treatment was ATG (anti-thymocyte
globulin) and chemo, a harsh immunosuppressive therapy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He would
now have to face months of more painful biopsies, countless emergency
transfusions, and a debilitating course of central-line chemotherapy. It’s
harrowing prospects for adult patients during the best of times; Cohen would
have to fight it at only five years of age.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Nonetheless,
he took the battle head on, his family by his side. And after 18 months of
treatment, his perseverance paid off. His conditioned went into remission. He
won.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The
coast seemed clear for Cohen to continue on his way toward a full and healthy
life. But in April of 2016, it was tragically discovered that the condition had
relapsed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cohen
would have to undergo a second, more extreme combination of chemo and
radiation. He would also require more BMTs if he has any chance of survival.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Remember,
Cohen has no biological siblings. But now more than ever, he needs a matching
brother or sister for transplants. If you can donate blood, marrow, or even
money to aid in the enormous financial burden his parents are having to face,
now is the time to act.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>
