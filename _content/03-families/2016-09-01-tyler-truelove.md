<p style="margin: 0px;">Tyler is an active teenager who loves
spending time with his family, the outdoors, comics. and superheroes. <br>
When Tyler was a baby, he developed a softball
sized choroid plexus papilloma tumor in his brain which was successfully
removed and Tyler had a shunt put in for drainage. <br>
In February 2016, Tyler needed a shunt revision
and had brain surgery at Doernbecher's Childrens Hospital in Portland. During
his stay, an MRI revealed two new tumors in his brain. One tumor was
successfully removed during surgery in March of 2016.<br>
 The second tumor is deep in the thalamus
region of Tyler's brain.  Tyler's doctors say surgery to remove it should
only be a last resort option.  This will require Tyler to have to travel
from Eugene where he lives to Doernbecher's in Portland for treatments and
frequent MRI monitoring. <br>
Tyler is also undergoing physical therapy to
work as a result of the tumors and operations. <br>
With money already tight, Tyler's family
recently lost a source of their income, and they could really use a little
help.<br>
It would mean so much to us to help this hard
working family have one less worry during their difficult time.  All money
donated will go towards medical costs not covered by insurance, therapy, and
getting them up to Portland for treatments, child care for Tyler's 5 year old
brother while Tyler is in treatment, and other costs related to medical
care.</p>
