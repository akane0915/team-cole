<p style="margin: 0px;">Kleon
Keang was diagnosed with Leukemia on January 21<sup>st</sup>. As a young,
active high school soccer star, the diagnosis took everyone who knows him by

was diagnosed with bone cancer.  </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">This
vibrant, intelligent young man is a senior at Union High School in Camas, WA.
Kleon is an avid participant in several school activities including the varsity
soccer team. As a first generation student, Kleon has worked exceptionally hard
to attain the goal of so many: go to college, attain a degree, and after,
continue his pursuit of the American dream.  </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">Kleon’s
path to these ideals has met with challenges he has overcome with perseverance.
The son of Cambodian immigrants, Kleon has led a life of no excuses. He lives
with his mother and contributes to the household to help make ends meet. But
this new situation greatly outweighs the monetary resources the two have at the
disposal. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">Let’s
band together to help Kleon. </p>
