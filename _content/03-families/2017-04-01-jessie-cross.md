<p style="margin: 0px;">Hi, my name is Jessie. I’m 11 years old. I love school and I
love to read and write stories.</p><p style="margin: 0px;">In January of 2014 I found out I had leukemia. It was a hard
battle but I beat it in June of 2016. I was so happy! But then in that
following November it came back with a vengeance. The cancer was now in my
kidneys.</p><p style="margin: 0px;">This caused me to be in a coma on my birthday and on
Christmas. I was really sick and none of the doctors had any idea what was
wrong with me. They weren’t even sure if I’d make it… but then I did.</p><p style="margin: 0px;">I’m happy at home feeling great! I eat as much as I want now
without a feeding tube. I have a bone marrow transplant scheduled soon, but
until then I will continue to fight.</p><p style="margin: 0px;">
