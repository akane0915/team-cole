summary: Clint has always been lively, happy and loving

<p style="margin: 0px;">Clint,
aka CU Later, is a 5 year old little boy who was born in Southern Oregon and
has always been a lively, happy, loving child.  On January 25, 2017, Clint
doubled over with belly pain.  Mom thought he had appendicitis and took him
into the pediatrician.  The doctors quickly recognized that it wasn't
appendicitis and rushed him over to the ER where they did a CT scan and
discovered a 13cm mass inside Clint's liver.  We were then lifeflighted to
Doernbecher's Childrens Hospital in Portland, OR where Clint was diagnosed with
Hepatoblastoma (Liver Cancer).  We immediately began an aggressive chemo
treatment.  Sadly, the first 4 rounds of chemo did not shrink the tumor to
be safely removed, so we were listed with Seattle Children's hospital for a
liver transplant.  On April 17, 2017, we got the call that a donor had
become available and we flew up to Seattle for a transplant on April 19. 
What a blessing that was!!  Surgery was a success!! Clint's body is very
happy with the new liver and he is recovering very well.  He has to stay
in Seattle for up to 3 months so that he can be monitored closely in order to
prevent rejection of the new organ.  We have resumed chemo treatment and
Clint is getting ready to begin his final round of chemo at the beginning of
June.</p><p style="margin: 0px;">Clint
is an inspiration to his family and friends.  We are all so very proud of
our amazing little SuperHero!!</p>
